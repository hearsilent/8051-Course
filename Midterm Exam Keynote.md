## Microcontrollers:
- __Microprocessors__, such as __8086__ family, have only __CCU__ and __ALU__ in them. External RAM, ROM, and I/O are required.
- __Microcontrollers__, such as __8051__ family, encompass __CCU__, __ALU__, __RAM__, __ROM__, and __I/O__ in a single chip.
- Microcontrollers have __limited__ computational __power__, but their __low-cost__ make them prevalent in comsumer products and small-scale control systems.

## Features:
- __8-bit__ CPU optimized for control applications
- __128 bytes__ of on-chip Data __RAM__, __4K bytes__ of on-chip Program Memory (__Flash Memory/ROM__)
- __64K Program Memory__ address space, __64K Data Memory__ address space
- __32__ bidirectional and individually addressable __I/O__ lines
- __Two 16-bit timer/counters__
- Full duplex programmable __UART__
- __6-source/5-vector interrupt__ structure with __two priority__ levels

## 8051 Development Tools:
- Assembler (ASEM-51)
	- An assembler is a program which creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents.
- Simulator (JSIM-51, Emulator 8051, Emily 8051/8052)
	- 8051 Microcontroller Simulator is one such application which through a simple and well organized interface offers the necessary tools and functions for emulating a physical microprocessor at work.
- Programmer
	- USB programmer to burn AT89S series 8051 microcontroller through USBasp.
- In-Circuit-Debugger (NoICE Remote Debugger)
	- With NoICE Remote Debugger, a monitor "MON8051.HEX" is programmed into ROM, which is controlled by "NoICE51.EXE" (running on PC) via RS232 to debug user program loaded into RAM.
- Disassembler (DIS8051 Cross-Disassembler)
	- A disassembler is a computer program that translates machine language into assembly languageâ€”the inverse operation to that of an assembler. 
- Editor (MIDE-51 Studio, Crimson Editor, MCU 8051 IDE)
	- MCU 8051 IDE is a free software integrated development environment for microcontrollers based on 8051. MCU 8051 IDE has its own simulator and assembler (support for some external assemblers is also available). This IDE supports 2 programming languages: C and Assembly language. For C language it uses SDCC.
	- Advanced text editor with syntax highlighting and validation.
- Terminal Emulator (Tera Term Pro)
	- RS232 Emulator
